### **🔍 Example Configuration**
```yaml
Release Version: v2.0.0
Source Environment: staging  
Target Environments: qa, production
Approval Required: ✓ Yes (for production)
Rollback Strategy: automatic
```

### **⏱️ Execution Time**
- Setup: 1-2 minutes
- Runtime: 5-20 minutes (depends on environments)

## 🔗 API Integration Workflow

### **🎯 Purpose**
Connect with external systems and trigger workflows based on API responses.

### **✨ Features** 
- **Multi-source support** (Nexus, Docker Hub, GitHub Releases, Custom APIs)
- **Conditional deployment** logic based on API data
- **Webhook notifications** for external systems
- **Version comparison** and artifact validation
- **Custom filtering** criteria for API responses

### **📋 Use Cases**
- **Automated deployments** when new artifacts are available
- **Integration with artifact repositories** (Nexus, Artifactory)
- **Version synchronization** across environments
- **External system notification** via webhooks

### **🔍 Example Configuration**
```yaml
API Source: docker-hub
API Endpoint: registry.hub.docker.com/v2/repos/myapp/tags
Filter Criteria: latest, stable
Action: conditional-deploy  
Webhook: https://hooks.slack.com/services/...
```

### **⏱️ Execution Time**
- Setup: 1-2 minutes
- Runtime: 3-10 minutes (includes API calls)
